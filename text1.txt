Updates:

The /gwf/operations/CDTOperator role has been updated in each account to enable permissions boundary

Assumptions / Requirements:
Preferred Method: Create a Role with Permissions Boundary using CloudFormation
Least Preferred Method: Create a Role with Permissions Boundary using CLI
Notes from Matt / SS-Prod example as of 10/24/2018
This page contains the draft directions for how to create IAM roles within a permission boundary.

Assumptions / Requirements:
You must assume an AWS role with permissions to create roles.
Roles may be created with CLI or CloudFormation.  
Currently, roles cannot be created using the console because Path is unsupported in the IAM console.
Roles must be created within the /gwf/apps/app_name/ path.  
Attempts to create roles that are in this path will result in an Access Denied message.
Policies must be created within the /gwf/apps/app_name/ path.  
Attempts to create policies that are not in this path will result in an Access Denied message.
Attempts to create roles with attached policies that are not in this path will result in an Access Denied message.
Attempts to create roles with AWS Managed Policies attached will result in an Access Denied message.
Create a Customer Managed version of the AWS Managed Policy, but replace any reference to Resource: "*" with an IAM Best Practice.
A permissions boundary must be attached to the role at the time of role creation.  There are two policies to choose from:
arn:aws:iam::<Account_Number>:policy/gwf/boundaries/apps/GwfAppPermissionsBoundaryWithIAM
This policy is intended to be used by roles that need to interact with Great-West Approved AWS Services and need to create other roles.
arn:aws:iam::<Account_Number>:policy/gwf/boundaries/apps/GwfAppPermissionsBoundaryWithoutIAM
This policy is intended to be used by roles that need to interact with Great-West Approved AWS Services.
Preferred Method: Create a Role with Permissions Boundary using CloudFormation
Requirements:

Access to AssumeRole to the /gwf/operations/CDTOperator or <Account_Name>-FullStackTeam role.
The ARN of an existing permissions boundary to attach to the Role (arn:aws:iam::<accountnumber>:policy/gwf/boundaries/apps/<boundaryname>).
A CloudFormation template.
Instructions:

Create a CloudFormation role template that includes the following properties:
AssumeRolePolicyDocument
Also known as a "trust policy."  See IAM Best Practices: IAM for examples of common trust policy patterns and code snippets.
ManagedPolicyArns
Managed Policies can be created in the same CloudFormation template and passed by reference.
Path
See AWS IAM and Path for details.
RoleName
Roles should follow a descriptive naming standard of <App_Name>-Description.  For example, if my application is called underwaterbasketweaver, I might create a role called UnderwaterBasketWeaver-LambdaWriteToS3Role.
Launch the CloudFormation stack from the template.
An example CloudFormation template in YAML format might look something like:

Least Preferred Method: Create a Role with Permissions Boundary using CLI
Requirements:

Access to AssumeRole to the /gwf/operations/CDTOperator or <Account_Name>-FullStackTeam role.
Shell access on is-xcloud05nb to obtain federated CLI credentials.
The ARN of an existing permissions boundary to attach to the Role (arn:aws:iam::<accountnumber>:policy/gwf/boundaries/apps/<boundaryname>).
The trust document for the role in json format.


Instructions:

Login to is-xcloud05nb using LDAP/Active Directory credentials

directions to create SAML token

federate in as /gwf/operations/CDTOperator role for the account that needs the role.

When creating the role, you will need a json file containing a trust policy which defines what service will be using the role.  There are some examples of trust policies in the IAM Best Practices guide. Here is an example for an EC2 role:

        "Service": "ec2.amazonaws.com"
      },
      "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
    }
  ]
}
Create a role with a particular boundary:  



[dfgkwg@is-xcloud05nb iamRoleTesting]$ aws iam create-role \
--permissions-boundary arn:aws:iam::<Account_Number>:policy/gwf/boundaries/apps/GwfAppPermissionsBoundaryWithoutIAM \
--role-name testRole3 --assume-role-policy-document file://ec2trust.json \

aws iam create-role --permissions-boundary <FULL PERMISSION BOUNDARY ARN> --role-name <ROLE NAME> --assume-role-policy-document file://<PATH TO TRUST DOCUMENT>.json --path /gwf/apps/<APP NAME>/ --profile saml

You should a response similar to the following:

        "Arn": "arn:aws:iam::676428981261:role/gwf/operations/services/mtthlg-test"
    }
}
 
For the boundaries, we’ve created 2 empty boundaries which can be used for testing in every account (the account number will differ by account)
 
arn:aws:iam::676428981261:policy/gwf/boundaries/operations/OperationsTestBoundary  
arn:aws:iam::676428981261:policy/gwf/boundaries/apps/AppsTestBoundary
 
For the ec2trust.json file, this depends on what the role will be used for, here is the example file content for if we are creating an ec2 role, the trust policy will depend on what service needs to use the role:
 
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "Service": "ec2.amazonaws.com"
      },
      "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
    }
  ]
}
After this role is created, you should be able to manage it via the console, or create new policies in cloudformation and attach them to this role. Only the initial creation of the role itself needs to be done via CLI, until the “PermissionsBoundary” option is available as part of the AWS::IAM::Role cloudformation resource properties.

LAMBDA_WARNING: Unhandled exception. The most likely cause is an issue in the function code. However, in rare cases, a Lambda runtime update can cause unexpected function behavior. For functions using managed runtimes, runtime updates can be triggered by a function change, or can be applied automatically. To determine if the runtime has been updated, check the runtime version in the INIT_START log entry. If this error correlates with a change in the runtime version, you may be able to mitigate this error by temporarily rolling back to the previous runtime version. For more information, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/runtimes-update.html
